The definition of Sequence is identical to `VRS Sequence <https://vrs.ga4gh.org/en/stable/terms_and_model.html#sequence>`__.

A *sequence* is a character string representation of a contiguous, linear polymer of nucleic acid or amino acid Residues. Sequences are the prevalent representation of these polymers, particularly in the domain of variant representation.

An *annotated sequence* is a sequence with associated annotations (e.g., features). Structurally, the class is simply a container for a Sequence and located features. This class may serve as a generalized parent class that can be specialized to support complex types of annotated sequences (e.g., transcripts).
